            Hi, I'm Mudasir, a passionate frontend developer with a focus on creating seamless and responsive user interfaces. I enjoy turning ideas into visually appealing and functional websites. I specialize in building user-friendly and efficient websites using modern technologies like TypeScript, Next.js, and CSS frameworks. My journey started with an interest in web design, which evolved into learning frontend technologies. I got admission in course of Generative AI, Web3, and Metaverse, where I developed projects using Next.js and TypeScript. Currently, my course is ongoing and i'm learning alot of things. Meanwhile I am enhancing my skills in responsive design and mobile-first development while building portfolio and blog websites to showcase my work.
